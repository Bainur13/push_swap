# push_swap – Stack Sorting Algorithm

## Description

**push_swap** is a sorting algorithm project where the goal is to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations.  
The project involves algorithmic optimization to minimize the total number of operations for any given input.

## Features

- Sorting of integer stacks using push, swap, rotate, and reverse rotate operations
- Optimized algorithms for small input sizes (mandatory)
- Advanced sorting strategies for large input sizes (bonus)
- Error handling (invalid input, duplicates, overflow)

## Skills & Concepts Practiced

✔️ Algorithm design and complexity optimization  
✔️ Data structures: stacks, linked lists  
✔️ Implementation of sorting strategies (greedy, radix, etc.)  
✔️ Input validation and error handling  
✔️ Writing efficient and maintainable C code

## Why this project matters

This project taught me algorithmic problem-solving under constraints, critical for technical interviews, competitive programming, and performance-critical applications.

## Project Status

✅ Completed with 125% score (including bonus)

## Usage Example

```bash
./push_swap 3 2 1
# Output: sa ra rra (example)
